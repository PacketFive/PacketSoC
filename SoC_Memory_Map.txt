Default AXI Data Width: 32 bits

Region                      | Start Address | End Address   | Size     | AXI Type  | Notes
----------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------
Boot ROM                    | 0x0001_0000   | 0x0001_FFFF   | 64 KB    | AXI-Lite* | For CPU initial boot code. *Typically direct or simpler bus.
Generic Peripherals         | 0x0200_0000   | 0x0200_FFFF   | 64 KB    | AXI-Lite  | UART, Timer, GPIO, etc.
Keystone Coprocessor CSRs   | 0x1000_0000   | 0x1000_0FFF   | 4 KB     | AXI-Lite  | Control/Status Registers for Keystone Coprocessor.
Main Memory (DRAM)          | 0x8000_0000   | 0xBFFF_FFFF   | 1 GB     | AXI4 Full | Main system memory.

**Notes:**

1.  **Boot ROM:** While listed as AXI-Lite for interconnect purposes, in a real system, the CPU might have a dedicated boot interface that directly accesses the Boot ROM at address `0x0000_0000` or another designated boot address (like `0x00010000` after reset). For this design, we'll assume it's accessible via the AXI interconnect for simplicity if the CPU's boot sequence allows fetching from this address.
2.  **Address Alignment:** All regions are assumed to be aligned to their size or appropriate AXI boundaries.
3.  **Keystone Coprocessor CSRs:** The size (4KB) matches the typical page size and provides ample space for the registers defined in `AXI_Lite_Memory_Map.txt` for the coprocessor.
4.  **Generic Peripherals:** A 64KB region is allocated. Specific peripherals will be mapped within this space.
5.  **Main Memory:** 1GB is a common size for embedded SoCs capable of running Linux or complex applications.
6.  **AXI Types:**
    *   **AXI4 Full:** Used for high-throughput access, typically for memory.
    *   **AXI-Lite:** Used for simpler, register-based access to control/status registers or low-bandwidth peripherals.
7.  **Unmapped Regions:** Accesses to addresses outside these defined regions should result in an AXI error response (DECERR).

This memory map will guide the design of the AXI interconnect's address decoding logic.
The CVA6 CPU will typically start fetching instructions from the Boot ROM address after reset.
The Keystone Coprocessor's DMA will primarily interact with Main Memory.
The CVA6 CPU will interact with Keystone Coprocessor CSRs, Main Memory, and Generic Peripherals.
